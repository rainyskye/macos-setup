## Things to do after a fresh run/install

** Some of these things I would like to eventually add to the main scripts/playbooks, however they're either:
- Not yet possible due to limitations in the applications configuration
- Not yet implemented, planned, or being implemented see [here](https://trello.com/b/FpK6GL5x/macos-setup) for things that are in-progress, and [here](https://github.com/rainyskye/macos-setup/issues/new?assignees=rainyskye&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+)
